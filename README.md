# Some Details From Sitba Proyect

## Purpose

The development of this application has many reasons.
The most simple AND straightfordward: deliver a product that satisfies the client needs.

That Is just the surface.
The main goals behind this development were to instruct a non-experienced developer in many of múltiple aspects required for a web development, Without compromising deliverable times and features.

The code in the app was 95% developed by someone that started with no React, no Typescript, no SQL, no HTTP, no Authentication mechanisms formal experience.

We put high priority to Interfaces, Services, Models definition, AND naming conventions.

With these we expect inspecting AND understanding the app be intutive AND Easy readable.

Since the app relies in intefaces AND strong type methods, improving perfomance AND extend development should not be an impediment.

Separating business lógic from components was also a priority.

We also took this opportunites to learn about vanguarding projects like Supabase, Vercel, and get used to PostgressSQL syntax

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

 `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

 `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

## Scripts to populate Data Base

   This project uses the following scripts to perform complex tasks:

- populatePayStudentsWithGroup - A script that populates the PostgreSQL database with data for students who are in a group.
  To access file, click [here](https://github.com/sitba-ct/institute-app/blob/main/script/populatePayStudentsWithGroup.sql)

- populatePayStudentsWithNoGroup - A script that populates the PostgreSQL database with data for students who are not in a group.
  To access file, click [here](https://github.com/sitba-ct/institute-app/blob/main/script/populatePayStudentsWithNoGroup.sql)

These scripts are complex and can be time-consuming to write. However, they can save you a lot of time and effort in the long run.

   To create the simple scripts this proyect use the next program:

- Mockaroo - A random data generator that can be used to create realistic data sets for testing and development.
